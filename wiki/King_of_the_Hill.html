<hr>
<span><strong>King of the Hill</strong>, or KOTH, is a minor event occuring in the Pit. The event lasts for 4 minutes.<br>When the event is active, a circle made of diamond blocks spawns in a random quadrant of the map. Standing on the structure quadruples all <a href="Gold.html">gold</a> and XP earned from kills and assists.<br><span>In order to receive the 4× bonus, the killer must be standing on diamond blocks. While upgrades, such as XP Boost and Gold Boost, increase a player's XP and gold, most perks, such as Olympus, are unaffected by the KOTH. Most notably, claiming a bounty on the KOTH will not reward the killer with 4× gold.</span><br><br>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>Two achievements can be earned from the KOTH event. "King of the XP" (15 Achievement Points) requires a player to earn 10,000 XP from kills and assists in a single event, and "Not much of a Hill" (10 Achievement Points) requires the player to stay on the diamond blocks of the KOTH for at least 3 minutes and 20 seconds.</span></div>
