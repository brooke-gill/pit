<hr>
<span><strong>Auction</strong> is a minor event in the Hypixel Pit. When the event starts, one randomly-generated item will be put up for auction. All players that were in the lobby when the auction started can bid on the item using <a href="Gold">gold</a>. Spending gold on the auction bypasses the gold trade limit. If the player loses the auction and is in the lobby when it ends, their gold will be refunded.<br><span>Players are unable to auction items themselves; the only way for players to sell items is through trading.</span><br><br>

<span>There are many types of items that may appear in an Auction event:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>Mystic Swords</li>
    <li>Mystic Pants</li>
    <li><a href="Philosophers_Cactus">Philosopher's Cactus</a></li>
    <li><a href="Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a></li>
    <li><a href="Fresh_Pants">Fresh Pants</a></li>
    <li>Renown</li>
    <li>Diamond Armor</li>
    <li>Funky Feathers, rarely</li>
    <li>Mystic Repair Kits, very rarely</li>
</ul>

        <td class="small center">A player bidding seven million gold on a Mystic Sword.</td>

<span>Before <a href="Prestige">prestiging</a>, higher-prestige players occasionally bid absurdly large amounts of gold on auctions as they have nowhere else to spend their gold.</span><br>
<span>The Mystic Pants enchants Pit MBA, Fractional Reserve, and Paparazzi are considered "exclusive auction enchants" and cannot be obtained from enchanting.</span><br>

<span>Admins, extremely rarely, auction off vanilla Minecraft items for sale. Named "admin items" by the community, these typically are blocks or flowers and are very valuable.</span><br>
<span>The Auction event was added in <a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/the-pit-update-0-4-events-extravaganza.2018236/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pit 0.4 - Events Extravaganza</a>. Two players were credited for its creation; one suggested the name "Shop Frenzy" for the event.</span></div>
