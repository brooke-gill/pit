<hr>

<span><strong>Uberstreak</strong> is a megastreak in the Hypixel Pit. It activates upon the player reaching 100 kills.<br>

<span>While the megastreak is active, the Uberstreak megastreak has one perk:</span>




<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">

<li>Gain +50% chance to find mystic items from kills.</li>

</ul>




<span>As players earn kills during an Uberstreak, their ability to get kills and stay alive becomes progressively worse. </span>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">

<li>At 100 kills, activate Uberstreak. Deal -40% damage to players with no prestige.</li>

  <li>At 200 kills, lose 2&hearts; max health.</li>

  <li>At 300 kills, potion effects last half as long as they normally do.</li>

  <li>At 400 kills, lose the ability to heal.</li>

</ul>




<span>After the player dies, if they had at least 400 kills, they will receive an Uberdrop.</span><br><br>

  <span>Uberdrops can contain: </span><br>

  <ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">

    <li>5-15 <a href = "Philosophers_Cactus">Philosopher's Cactus</a></li>

    <li>1-2 <a href = "Funky_Feather">Funky Feather</a></li>

  <li>1 Mystic Sword with the Hidden Jewel enchant</li>

  <li>1 Totally Legit Gem</li>

</ul>

  <span>Unlike most megastreaks, there is a limit to rewards earned from Uberstreak. Every day, players may only earn an Uberdrop four times. While the first daily Uberdrop is free, the second, third, and fourth ones cost 5, 10, and 15 <a href="Renown">renown</a> respectively. After the fourth daily Uberdrop, players will no longer receive Uberdrops until the next day.</span><br><br>


  <span>Unlike other megastreaks, no other <a href="Killstreaks">killstreaks</a> are bundled with Uberstreak.</span><br>
<br>

<span>While Uberdrops are extremely difficult to obtain, their high value causes many players to attempt Uberstreaks.</span>
