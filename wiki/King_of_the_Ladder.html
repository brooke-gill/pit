<hr>
<span><strong>King of the Ladder</strong>, or KOTL, is a <a href="Minor_Event">minor event</a> occuring in the Pit. The event lasts for 3 minutes.<br>When the event is active, a structure out of green hardened clay spawns in a random quadrant of the map. Standing on the structure rewards gold every second, with a higher rate of gold being rewarded at higher-up platforms. When more than one player is on a platform of the structure, the gold is distributed evenly between every player that is standing on it, incentivizing players to hit each other off.<br><br>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>KOTL was added in <a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/the-pit-update-0-4-events-extravaganza.2018236/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pit 0.4 - Events Extravaganza</a>. Twelve players were credited to its creation; players suggested names such as "Ladder Wars" or "Hard-point" for the event.</span><br><span>Standing on a King of the Ladder structure for more than 20 seconds in one event gives the player the "Up on top" achievement, worth 10 Achievement Points.</span></div>
