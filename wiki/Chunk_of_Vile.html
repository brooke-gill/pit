<span><strong>Chunks of Vile</strong>, commonly referred to as "vile", are items in The Pit that are used to create special types of <a href="Fresh_Pants">fresh pants</a>. They can be earned in contracts with the Heresy Renown upgrade, completing Night Quests, and through <a href="Auction">auctions</a>.<br><br><span>Fresh dark pants can be crafted with 5 Chunks of Vile and the Heresy Renown upgrade unlocked at prestige <span class="me">VI</span>. This cost decreases by 1 for every level of Heresy the player has unlocked (minimum of 3). Fresh rage pants require 17 Chunks of Vile to craft and the Pure Rage Renown upgrade, unlocked at <a href="Prestige">prestige</a> <span class="me">IX</span>.</span><br><br><span>Due to the popularity of vile, it is commonly used as currency in trading because of the gold trading limits.</span><br><span>Chunks of Vile can also be used to repair mystic items. The megastreak Grand Finale will increase a player's chosen mystic item's lives by 4. This cost is 4 Chunks of Vile for most items&mdash; the exception is for gemmed items, which cost 8 vile to repair.</span><br>

<span>The "Do Your Own Carpentry" Renown upgrade grants players twice as much vile than usual for completing contracts.</span></span></div>
