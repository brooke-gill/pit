<hr>
<span><strong>Dark Pants</strong> are special types of <a href = "fresh_Pants">Fresh Pants</a> designed to counter mysticism. They can be crafted for 5 <a href = "Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a> and 2 <a href = "Renown">renown</a> <strong>at night</strong> if the user has at least one tier of the Prestige <span class="me">VI</span> <a href = "Renown">renown</a> upgrade Heresy. Every extra tier of Heresy the player has reduces the vile cost of Dark Pants by 1.</span><br>
<span>Dark pants function differently from fresh pants. Upgrading dark pants to tier I requires 10,000 <a href = "Gold">gold</a> and Heresy I, but unlike typical mystic pants, it does not require Mysticism IX. Tier I Dark Pants will always be enchanted with Somber and have 5-20 lives. To upgrade to tier II, the player must have Mysticism IX, Heresy III, and 60,000g, at which point the pants will be enchanted with a random dark enchant.</span><br>
<span>Dark pants enchantments typically are very strong, but have a negative effect to the user to compensate.  
<span>The list of Dark enchants is as follows:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>Somber: You are immune to mystic enchantments. You cannot use mystic enchantments while wearing these pants.</li>
    <li>Hedge Fund: Gain +6g per kill. If the target was wearing Tier I+ mystic pants, gain +66g instead. Lose 50g on death.</li>
    <li>Needless Suffering: Respawn with 30 hearts of absorption. Cannot heal by any method. Must die once while wearing these pants to gain absorption.</li>
    <li>Sanguisuge: Heal 1 hp on hit (2s cooldown). Heal 2 hp instead if the Vampire perk is equipped. The regeneration effect has no effect on the user.</li>
    <li>Lycanthropy: At nighttime, gain +10% XP and <a href = "Gold">gold</a> on kill, permanent speed I and regeneration II. Lose these effects with day breaks and you cannot gain speed for the day after wearing these pants.</li>
    <li>Grim Reaper: If a player dies within 10 blocks, deal 4 damage to them and earn that damage as an assist on the player's death. Earn -80% gold and XP.</li>
    <li>Misery: If your target is wearing leather armor, deal +1 true damage to them on all your hits. Take 0.6 true damage on all hits received.</li>
    <li>Spite: If your target is wearing leather armor, deal +20% damage to them. Take 5% more damage from players wearing leather armor.
    <li>Mind Assault: Deal -60% damage. Every player within 12 blocks wearing leather armor increases your damage by +1.5. Max of +16.
    <li><span class = "md">RARE!</span> Combo: Venom: Every third hit poisons the target for 12 seconds and yourself for 24 seconds. While poisoned, players receive the Somber effect.</li>
    <li><span class = "md">RARE!</span> Golden Handcuffs: After claiming a bounty, 4x the bounty is shared between all players on the server. Requires 30 players in the server to activate.</li>
    <li><span class = "md">RARE!</span> Nostalgia: Take -10% damage. Diamond armor glows as if enchanted.</li>
    <li><span class = "md">RARE!</span> Heartripper: Every life removed from a mystic through killing while wearing these pants grants these pants +1 bloodshard. Earning 27 bloodshards grants 1 pair of fresh pants. Consume 2 lives of this item when generating fresh pants. When dark pants gain this enchant on upgrade, their max lives do not increase.</li>
</ul>
<span>If Dark Pants have 100 lives or more, they are referred to as Evil Pants.</span><br><br>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>Dark Pants used to be as strong as chainmail pants, this was changed to leather in early 2020.</span><br>
<span>The time period the Nostalgia enchantment refers to is the time before the <a href = "https://hypixel.net/threads/the-pit-0-3-5-second-map-and-mystic-well.1729768/">0.3.5</a> update, when Protection I diamond armor could be found in Care Packages.</span></span></div>
