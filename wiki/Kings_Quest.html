<span>The&nbsp;<strong>King's Quest</strong> is a mission given by the King on the Castle Map. Upon its completion, the King will reward the player with 30% of their <a href="Prestige.html">prestige</a>'s XP requirement, several thousand <a href="Gold.html">gold</a>, and a <a href="Golden_Helmet.html">Golden Helmet</a>. The quest is available starting at prestige <span class="m9">I</span>.</span>
<br><span>After talking to the King, in order to complete the King's Quest, three tasks must be completed:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
<li>Bring a <a href="Mini_Cake.html">Mini Cake</a>;</li>
  <li>Kill 100 players;</li>
<li>Collect 10 Renown from events.</li></ul>
<span>All three of these tasks must be completed in the time between starting the quest and the map rotation every Tuesday. The King's Quest is repeatable— it can be completed every time the Castle map appears; this happens every five weeks.</span><br>
<span>The XP and gold earned from the King's Quest depends on the player's prestige. For example, completing the King's Quest at prestige <span class="m9">I</span> awards 22,000 XP, yet completing the same quest at prestige <span class="md">XXV</span> awards 720,000 XP. The XP earned from the King's Quest is approximately 30.326% of the player's prestige. The only exception is if the player is level 106 or higher— in that case, the player will only be given exactly enough XP to level up to [<span class="mb">120</span>].</span><br><br><span>The gold earned from the King's Quest can be calculated by multiplying the player's prestige by 2,000 and adding 10,000. For instance, a prestige <span class="me">VII</span> player would earn (2,000 × <span class="me">7</span>) + 10,000 = 24,000g from the King's Quest.</span>
<br><br>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>Completing the King's Quest for the first time will award the player with the "All hail the King!" achievement, worth 20 Achievement Points.</span><br>
<span>The King's Quest was added in <a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/the-pit-0-4-1-castle-map-dark-pants.2058146/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pit 0.4.1</a> on May 22nd, 2019, along with the Castle Map and Dark Pants.</span>
<br>
<span>At prestige 50, completing the King's Quest would reward a player with 2,000,000,000 (two billion) XP.</span></span></div>
