<span><strong>Chunks of Vile</strong>, commonly referred to as "vile", are items in The Pit that are used to create special types of <a href="Fresh_Pants">fresh pants</a>. They can be earned in contracts with the Heresy Renown upgrade, completing Night Quests, and through <a href="Auction">auctions</a>.<br><br><span>With the Heresy Renown upgrade unlocked at <a href="Prestige">prestige</a> <span class="me">VI</span>, fresh dark pants can be crafted with 5 Chunks of Vile. This cost decreases by 1 for every level of Heresy the player has unlocked (minimum of 3). With the Pure Rage renown upgrade unlocked at prestige <span class="me">IX</span>, Fresh Rage Pants can be crafted using 17 Chunk of Vile.</span><br><br><span>Due to the popularity of vile, it is commonly used as currency in trading because of the gold trading limits.</span><br><span>Chunks of Vile can also be used to repair mystic items. The megastreak Magnum Opus will consume Chunks of Vile to repair up to four lives on a mystic item. One Chunk of Vile will be expended for every life repaired, unless the item has had a Totally Legit Gem applied, in which case two will be consumed per life.</span><br><br>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>The "Do Your Own Carpentry" Renown upgrade increases the chance to grant Chunk of Vile from contracts and grants players twice as much vile than usual for completing contracts.</span></span></div>
