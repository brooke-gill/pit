<hr>
<span><strong>Aqua Pants</strong> are special types of <a href = "fresh_Pants">Fresh Pants</a>. They can be caught rarely while fishing if the user has the Prestige <span class="m9">III</span> <a href = "Renown">renown</a> upgrade Fishing Club at tier V. Most of their possible enchantments assist the player while fishing.</span><br>
<span>Aqua pants function differently from fresh pants. They can only be upgraded to tier 1, at which point they will have 5 lives, the Club Rod enchantment, and a random Aqua enchant. The Club Rod enchant grants the user a fishing rod while worn.</span><br>
<span>The list of other Aqua enchants is as follows:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>Rogue: Deal +25% damage and take 10% less damage from players who are wearing Aqua Pants.</li>
    <li>Tough Crew: Receive -15% damage if there are at least 3 players wearing Aqua Pants near you.</li>
    <li>Unite: You cannot make contact with players wearing aqua pants.</li>
    <li>Rodback: Fishing rod hooks deal increased knockback.</li>
    <li>Grandmaster: Fishing rod hooks deal 1 true damage.</li>
    <li>Portable Pond: Spawn with a water bucket. Can be used 4 times before becoming empty. You cannot pick up water using the empty bucket. </li>
    <li>Trophy: When catching gold ingots, catch two more.</li>
    <li><span class = "md">RARE!</span> Stereo: Play a random Hypixel song to all players nearby while worn.</li>
    
</ul>
<span>The chance to catch aqua pants is unknown but is much lower than other fishing drops.</span><br><br>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>Before a patch in late April 2020, Combo enchants could be used with Unite to activate them without a cooldown. This interaction led to exploits with the Combo: Exp enchant, allowing players to gain exp extremely quickly.</span><br>
