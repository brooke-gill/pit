<h2 id="section-basic">Basic Site Usage</h2>
<p><b>brookeafk.com</b> is a website used to track when events in the <a href="https://pit.wiki/The_Hypixel_Pit" target="_blank">Hypixel Pit</a> occur. This can be helpful if players want to participate in specific events or are curious about what's about to happen in-game.</p>
<img src="./help_images/example.png" class="bigimage">
<p>On the site, events are displayed in order. The timestamps on the right are a countdown until the event happens and a 24-hour timestamp as to the time of the event happening in your local time zone. For <a href="https://pit.wiki/Major_Event" target="_blank">major events</a>, this countdown and timestamp refer to when the three-minute in-game countdown for the event starts, not the actual starting time of the event. This is to be consistent with <a href="https://pit.wiki/Pit_Supporter" target="_blank">Pit Supporter</a>. Major events are also indicated with a faint white outline around the event.</p>


<h2 id="section-settings">Settings</h2>
<p>To change brookeafk.com's settings, click the Settings icon (<span style="font-family: Material">settings</span>). A settings menu will drop down with various items to click.</p>

<img src="./help_images/settings_menu.png" width="100%">

<p>The items are the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Theme</b>: Changes whether the background is black or white. It also changes the palettes!</li>
    <li><b>Palette</b>: Changes the colors of the events. There's nine of them in total; try clicking each one to see the colors.</li>
    <li><b><span class="me">Pre-event notifications</span></b>: These notify the user when certain events are about to start.<br><b>NOTE:</b> Many Chrome users have told me that they don't receive notifications when brookeafk.com isn't focused. I have searched for a solution to this, but have came up with nothing. If you're having this problem, make sure <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3220216?hl=en" target="_blank">Chrome can send notifications</a> or switch to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/" target="_blank">another non-Chromium browser</a>. Alternatively, just create a new window in Chrome (<kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>) and use that for your brookeafk.com needs.<br>Upon clicking <code>5m</code>, <code>3m</code>, or <code>1m</code>, more settings options will appear.</li>
<ul><li><b>Audio notifications</b>: Whether you'll be notified through a chime on the site.</li>
    <li><b>Desktop notifications</b>: Whether you'll be notified through notifications on your desktop.</li>
<li>Additionally, bell icons (<span style="font-family: Material">notifications</span>) will appear to the right of the event names on the right side of the page. Clicking one of these will enable notifications for that event.</li></ul>
    <li><b>Timestamps</b>: Toggles certain countdown timers and clocks. <b>Time of Day</b> is the timestamp that displays when an event will happen (e.g. 11:56). <b>Time Until Event</b> is the countdown timer to each event (e.g. 23m 51s). <b>Day and Map</b> controls the bar that displays the day-night cycle and the map change timer.</li>
    <li><b>Flashing text</b>: Changes the amount of time until an event starts flashing and turning red.You can disable it by pressing <code>Never</code>.</li>
    <li><b>Font</b>: Controls the typeface of everything on the site. The default font is <b>Inter</b>, which is all of this text. <span style="font-family: minecraft"><b>Minecraft</b> is this typeface.</span> <span style="font-family: sans-serif"><b>Sans-serif</b> defaults to the default sans-serif font on your browser (this one). Learn how to change this here: <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-fonts-and-colors-websites-use#w_changing-font" target="_blank">Firefox</a> &ndash; <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/change-default-font-chrome/" target="_blank">Chrome</a> &ndash; <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/changing-fonts-microsoft-edge-windows-10" target="_blank">Edge</a></span>.</li>
    <li>The names of events on the right (Pizza, Raffle, Squads, etc.) will toggle the visibility of the event. Selecting <b>Majors Only</b> will automatically only show major events. <b>Minors Only</b> will do the same for minor events. <b>Select All</b> and <b class="mc">Deselect All</b> will show and hide all events respectively. <b class="mc">Clear Settings</b> will completely erase all settings you've entered into the site. <b>Preview Audio</b> will play the aforementioned chime to make sure it works on your device.</li>
</ul> 

<h2 id="section-faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>The timestamps on the site are wrong</h3>
<ul><li>This is most likely an issue with your system clock being wrong, too. I recommend you fix that first&mdash;it'll mess with a bunch of other web pages too&mdash;but if you're looking for a quick solution, try appending <code>?offset=MINUTES</code> to the URL, where <code>MINUTES</code> is the number of minutes you'd like all of the timestamps to change by. <code><a href="https://brookeafk.com?offset=-180" target="_blank">https://brookeafk.com?offset=-180</a></code> would move all of the timestamps backwards by three hours.</li></ul>

<h3>There's no events</h3>
<ul><li>First of all, try reloading the page (use <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>). That'll usually solve it. If that doesn't work, you should do one of two things depending on what you see at <a href="control.js" target="_blank">this link</a>:</li><ul><li><code>var emergency = false</code>: Check out <a href="https://events.mcpqndq.dev" target="_blank">McPqndq's events API</a>. If you see a bunch of sprawling JSON code that looks like <code>[{"event":"Rage Pit","timestamp":1676589300000,"type":"major"} ...</code>, then it's likely an issue with your system. Try a different browser, device, or IP address. If you don't see anything, see only <code>[]</code> and nothing else, or get a Cloudflare error, <b>please contact me immediately</b> (Brooke#0843).</li><li><code>var emergency = true</code>: Reload the page like twenty times (using <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to clear the cache), and then contact me (Brooke#0843) if that doesn't work.</li></ul></ul>

<h3>How do I go back to the old version of brookeafk.com?</h3>
<ul><li>Is the site too gradient-y for you now? Click <a href="https://brookeafk.com/2022" target="_blank">here</a> or go to <a href="https://brookeafk.com/2022" target="_blank">brookeafk.com/2022</a>. I won't be mad.</ul>

<h3>How do I get a quote on the bottom of the site?</h3>
<ul><li>The quotes on the bottom were the people who supported me back when brookeafk.com was in its <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pP78ifctBLkuIPH2lg5pzTS2s1pDTXXPMGYVnKgvlug/edit#gid=108982194" target="_blank">archaic spreadsheet phase</a> and didn't have nearly as much support as it does now. I'm currently not looking for more quotes on the bottom of the site&mdash;my apologies.</li></ul>

<h3>Why does your code suck?</h3>
<ul><li>It was my first JavaScript project ðŸ¥² I mean, if it works, it works... right? Why are you even looking at the code anyway? If it's not working, that's a whole other issue. The GitHub repo for this page is <a href="https://github.com/brooke-gill/pit" target="_blank">here</a>.</ul>

<h3>Why didn't you use ClumplunkleJS or <code>[insert random JavaScript library]</code>? Why's it all client-side?</h3>
<ul><li>There's no need to. It's a really simple site with a simple purpose. What would I use something like that for, anyway? (also because I can't be bothered learning React)</li></ul>

<h3>But you could've just implemented Clumplunkle's <code>BlorgleFlorgle()</code> method and it would cure cancer and&mdash;</h3>
<ul><li><i>SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT</i></li></ul>
