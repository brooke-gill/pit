<hr>
<span><strong>Giant Cake</strong> is a <a href="Minor_Event">minor event</a> occuring in the Pit. The event lasts for 2 minutes.<br>When the event occurs, a giant cake, created by hundreds of smaller cakes in a cuboid shape, spawns in a random area of the map. Players are able to eat slices of the cake by right- or left-clicking them. Players will receive <a href="Gold">gold</a> for eating slices of cake; their rewards increase the more cake they consume. Most cake slices award 1 gold. This increases by 0.25 gold for every 50 cake slices eaten. Eating the last slice of a cake awards 5 gold, increasing by 1.25g for every 50 slices eaten.</span><br>
<span>Two additional types of cake exist in the giant cake:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
<li><span><strong>Cherries</strong> (red stained clay), which award 150 gold, increasing by 37.5g for every 50 slices eaten;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong> (black stained clay), which award 100 XP. The XP earned from chocolate chips is unaffected by XP Boost.</span></li>
</ul>

<span>Eating a whole cake inside the giant cake has a chance for it to drop tasty <strong>Milk</strong>, granting <span class="me">2&hearts;</span> of Absorption, and <strong>Cookies</strong>, granting 25 seconds of Speed II.</span><br><br>
