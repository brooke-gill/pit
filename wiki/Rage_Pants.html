<hr>
<span><strong>Rage Pants</strong> are special types of <a href = "fresh_Pants">Fresh Pants</a>. They can be crafted for 17 <a href = "Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a> if the user has the Prestige <span class="me">IX</span> <a href = "Renown">renown</a> upgrade Pure Rage.</span><br>
<span>Rage pants function differently from fresh pants. When enchanted to tier 1, they will always have 4 or 9 lives and 1-2 tiers of a special Rage enchant. Once enchanted to tier I, rage pants become functionally identical to typical mystic pants.</span><br>
<span>The list of Rage enchants is as follows:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>Ace of Spades: Take 1/2/3 less damage from Combat Spades.</a></li>
    <li>Really Toxic: Hits apply stacks of toxicity for 30 seconds. Toxicity stacks reduce the target's healing by 2% per stack. Max 10/15/20 stacks.</li>
    <li>Heigh-Ho: Deal 1/2/3 more damage to players wearing pants with Mirror.</li>
    <li>New Deal: Gain immunity to the Billionaire enchant. Also take 0/4/8% less damage.</li>
    <li>Do it like the French: Deal 1/2/3 more damage to players wearing <a href = "Golden Helmet">Golden Helmets</a>.</li>
    <li>Combo: Breaching Charge: Every 4/3/2 hits removes Resistance from the target.</li>
    <li>Sybil: You count as 2/3/4 players to enchants and perks (excluding Shark).</li>
    <li><span class = "md">RARE!</span> Think of the People: Players within 10 blocks gain immunity to Executioner and Combo: Perun's Wrath. They also take 0/10/20% less damage from swords with those enchants.</li>
    <li><span class = "md">RARE!</span> Regularity: If the damage of your attack deals less than 2.2/2.6/3 damage, automatically strike again in 0.1s. The second strike hits for 40/60/75% of the first hit's damage.</li>
</ul>
<span>If there is a level III Rage enchant on the pants, they gain the Malding prefix. If the pants have 8 total tokens, they gain the Manic prefix.</span><br><br>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>On release, a <span class = "md">RARE!</span> rage enchant called Deal with the Devil was also released. It disabled the Devil Chicks enchant in an entire lobby. The enchantment was removed almost immediately.</span><br>
<span>If a pair of Rage Pants are upgraded to Malding or Manic, it is announced to the entire lobby.</span></span></div>
