<span>The&nbsp;<strong>Mini Cake</strong> is an item used to complete the <a href="Kings_Quest.html">King's Quest</a> on the Castle map.</span>
<br><span>To bake the Mini Cake, the following five items are needed:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
<li>Forty&nbsp;<strong>Hay Bales</strong>, obtained by right-clicking a crafting table with a stack of wheat;</li>
<ul>
  <li>The crafting tables are located in a water mill at (103, 76, 9).</li><br>
</ul>
<li>Six&nbsp;<strong>Eggs</strong>, obtained by feeding Yummy Bread to chickens;</li>
<ul>
  <li>To obtain Yummy Bread, a player needs to right click any furnace in the Kings map with 64 wheat. These furnaces can be found in the barn located at (55, 77, -85).</li>
  <li>The player will then need to go to the Forest quadrant of the map. Upon reaching the shooting range located at (-94, 80, -31), the player will need to stand on the red clay and shoot a target in front of them. This will cause a chicken to fly out; feeding one Yummy Bread to it will cause it to lay an egg.</li><br>

</ul>
<li>Twelve&nbsp;<strong>Sugar Extract</strong>, obtained by mining melon blocks with an axe;</li>
<ul>The axe is obtained from the Barbarian Renown upgrade. It costs 10 <span class="me">Renown</span> and requires <a href="Prestige.html">prestige</a> <span class="m9">II</span>. The melons are located on the ship in the Port quadrant; they can be found at (-16, 67, 100).</ul><br>
<li>Two&nbsp;<strong>Milk Buckets</strong>, found in chests in the Sewers;</li>
<ul>The sewers can be found beneath the City quadrant. In the sewers, chests frequently spawn, infrequently containing milk.</ul><br>
<li>One&nbsp;<strong>Cherry</strong>, a rare drop from killing players.</li>
</ul>
<span>If the player is unable to complete one or more of these items themselves, they may trade with other players to obtain them.</span><br>
<span>After all of these items are collected, the player will need to talk to the Baker, an NPC that spawns in a random position of the map. Upon giving the baker these ingredients, they will be given one Mini Cake.</span>
<br><br>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>Baking a cake will award the player with the "Baker" achievement, worth 10 Achievement Points.</span><br>
<span>Mini Cakes were added in <a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/the-pit-0-4-1-castle-map-dark-pants.2058146/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pit 0.4.1</a>, along with the Castle Map and Dark Pants.</span>
